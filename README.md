# Statistics Quiz 📝

A lightweight multiple-choice quiz program that helps you review
introductory statistics concepts.  
Developed as the **COMP9001 Python Project Challenge (5 %)** to
demonstrate object-oriented design, file I/O, simple data analytics, and a
GUI built with Tkinter.

---

## 1 · Quick Start

```bash
# clone / unzip the project, then:
cd stat_quiz_project_v3

# install runtime dependencies
pip install matplotlib          # Tkinter ships with Python

# launch
python main.py
```

---
Python 3.9+ is recommended.
On macOS, if the GUI fails to open, run brew reinstall python-tk.

## 4 · Editing the Question Bank

Open data/banks/statistics.json; each entry looks like:
``` bash
{
  "question": "Approximately what percentage of observations fall within ±2σ?",
  "options": ["68 %", "95 %", "99.7 %", "50 %"],
  "answer": 1
}

Add, remove, or edit questions as needed. The app reloads the file at start-up.
```
